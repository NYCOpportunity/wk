At the <a href="http://nyc.gov/opportunity" target="_blank">Mayor's Office for Economic Opportunity</a> we work to improve the systems of government by advancing the use of research, data and design in program and policy development, service delivery, and budget decisions. Our work includes analyzing existing anti-poverty approaches, developing new strategies, facilitating the sharing of data across City agencies, and rigorously assessing the impact of key initiatives.

We are seeking candidates for design, data, research, policy, and technology roles to develop and support digital products and programs that reduce poverty and advance opportunity for City residents.
